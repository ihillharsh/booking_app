# Generated Assets

This folder contains auto-generated code from `flutter_gen`.

**DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS FOLDER MANUALLY**

These files are automatically generated when you run:
```bash
fluttergen
```

To regenerate after adding new assets:
1. Add your assets to the appropriate folder (assets/images, assets/icons, or assets/fonts)
2. Run `fluttergen`
3. Import and use the generated classes in your code

See `ASSETS_GUIDE.md` in the project root for detailed usage instructions.
